## Exercise 81 - Some Variables

# Write a small Python program that declares and assigns at
# least 10 Variables of different types (int, string, float, bool).
# Use print to show them in the terminal.

pi = 3.1415
age = 28
name = "Romina"
is_learning = True
super_long_variable_name_for_number_one = 1
country = "Germany"
feeling_today = "I'm fine, thanks"
sum = 546
months = 12
bad_variable_name = 5.273

print(pi)
print(age)
print(name)
print(is_learning)
print(super_long_variable_name_for_number_one)
print(country)
print(feeling_today)
print(sum)
print(months)
print(bad_variable_name)
