## Getting started

# Programming tutorials always start with the program called “Hello World”.
# We will do the same.
# You have to create a file HelloWorld.py with atom.
# Open a new file and save it as HelloWorld.py.
# Then add the following line to the script.
print("Hello World!")

# Add the following commands to the file.
print("Jack and Jill went up a hill")
print("to fetch a pail of water;")
print("Jack fell down, and broke his crown,")
print("and Jill came tumbling after.")
